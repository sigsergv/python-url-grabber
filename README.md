python-url-grabber
==================

Simple module that simplifies downloads of many files from site.

Requires Python3 (>=3.3).

The main ideas behind this module:

 * cache all urls so repeated requests won't download files again;
 * use “real world” user agents;
 * automatically handle various page encodings.
